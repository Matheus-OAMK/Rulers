# [Rulers](https://rulers-sh.com/index.html)
### This project is made for OAMK web development project course, as final project of first year. </h3>


## Description 
The aim of the project was to make a small scale web-application that users can sign up, interact, and store data. Considering the requirements we built **Rulers** a webapp where users can log-in, purchase cards, play a card game and store their cards in their own collection.</p>
 
## The process
The total project duration was 7 week. We started with creating a user-centered backlog and proceeded with defining requirements based on the backlog. We followed Scrum as a project development system and used Hacknplan as the project development tool. Each week one of us took the role of Scrum master. We started the sprints by defining the tasks every Monday and ended the sprint on Sunday with a sprint review. We had a meeting every weekday, meeting durations were flexible. You can visit our [hacknPlan](https://app.hacknplan.com/p/183399/kanban?categoryId=0&boardId=506202) to see the project development process in detail.
